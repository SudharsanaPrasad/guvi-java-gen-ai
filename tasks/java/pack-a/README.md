# Java Practice Pack A

This practice pack covers the concepts learned in Lecture 1–6 (inclusive) in the Java module. Please refer to the [learning path](https://github.com/Nikhilnair48/guvi-java-gen-ai/blob/main/Learning%20Path%20-%20SDE%20with%20AI%20-%20SDE%20With%20AI.pdf) for the list of concepts.

## Submission format

Create **one** project folder and place **all** task files inside a single `src/` folder.

- Create a folder: `java-pack-a/<your_name>/`
- Inside it, create: `src/`
- Put Task **A1, A2, A3, A5, A6** files directly under `src/` (default package)
  - These files must **not** have a `package ...;` line at the top
- Put Task **A4** files under `src/com/app/...` (packaged)
  - These files must have the correct `package com.app...;` line at the top

Your folder structure must look like this:

```text
java-pack-a/
  <your_name>/
    src/
      StoryGenerator.java                 (Task A1)
      TextTriage.java                     (Task A2)
      Thermostat.java                     (Task A3)
      ThermostatDemo.java                 (Task A3)
      PasswordReferee.java                (Task A5)
      UserRegistrationValidator.java      (Task A6)
      ValidationException.java            (Task A6)

      com/
        app/
          main/
            Main.java                     (Task A4)
          text/
            TextTriage.java               (Task A4)
            InternalTextRules.java        (Task A4)
            TextConstants.java            (Task A4)
          device/
            Thermostat.java               (Task A4)
```

## Rules

- Do **not** use the Collections Framework in Pack A (`ArrayList`, `HashMap`, etc.).
- Strings and arrays are allowed.
- Use loops and basic control flow.
- Follow the task requirements exactly (file names, class names, method names, and required test cases).
