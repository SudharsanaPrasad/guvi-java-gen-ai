# Java Practice Pack A

The first pack of problems will cover the concepts learned in lecture 1-6 (inclusive) in the Java module. Please refer to the [learning path](https://github.com/Nikhilnair48/guvi-java-gen-ai/blob/main/Learning%20Path%20-%20SDE%20with%20AI%20-%20SDE%20With%20AI.pdf) on the concepts covered.

## Submission format

- Create a folder: `java-pack-a/<your_name>/`
- Create a sub-folder for each task (eg: `java-pack-a/nikhil/task-1`, `java-pack-a/nikhil/task-2`)
  - Each task has its own Java file, except for Task A4 
  - Task A2 uses a small package structure. Submit the package, including the Java files
- The submission URL will be shared in lecture

## Rules

- Do **not** use the Collections Framework in Pack A (`ArrayList`, `HashMap`, etc.).
- Strings and arrays are allowed.
- Use loops and basic control flow.
- Follow the task requirements exactly (file names, class names, method names, and required test cases).
