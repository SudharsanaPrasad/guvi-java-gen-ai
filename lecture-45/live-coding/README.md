- The project was broken down into [tasks and assigned to learners](https://github.com/Nikhilnair48/guvi-java-gen-ai/discussions/95#discussioncomment-15518329)
- Upon the completion of each task, the `main` in `App.java` was written to complete the project, which is available in [this folder](https://github.com/Nikhilnair48/guvi-java-gen-ai/tree/main/lecture-45/live-coding/student-mini-project/)
